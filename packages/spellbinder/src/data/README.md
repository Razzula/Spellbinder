# Categorisation Rules for Player-Facing Systems

---

## 1. **CARDS** (Abilities, Spells)
**Definition:**  
Player-triggered, *active choices* that use action economy (Action, Bonus Action, Reaction), or represent deliberate decisions during play.

**Examples:**
- Attacks with specific weapons  
- Casting spells  
- Class features that require Action or Bonus Action (e.g. `Rage`, `Hunter’s Mark`)  
- Weapon Masteries (e.g. `Push`, `Sap`, `Nick`)  
- Feat/class features like `Battle Medic`

### **RESPONSES**
**Definition:**  
Triggered, *optional* player choices that do **not** consume action economy, but require player intent. Often occur outside the turn structure.

**Examples:**
- `Luck` – reroll a 1 on a d20 Test  
- `Healing Rerolls` – reroll 1s on healing dice  
- `Initiative Swap` – swap initiative with a willing ally after rolling

## 2. **ANNOTATIONS**
**Definition:**  
Passive rules that *modify* Cards or Responses. They are not actionable themselves but change how choices function.

**Examples:**
- `Darkvision`  
- `Brave` – Advantage on saves vs Frightened  
- `Martial Arts` – Use DEX for unarmed attacks, Grapple/Shove DCs  
- `Rage Effects` – while Raging, gain resistance and bonuses  
- Weapon traits used via class abilities (e.g. `Nick`, `Sap`, `Slow`)  
- `Tremorsense` – with condition (e.g. on stone)

---

## 3. **IGNORED (Mathsy/Out-of-Play)**
**Definition:**  
Anything that only affects character creation, levelling, or background narrative. These don’t impact in-combat or moment-to-moment gameplay directly.

**Examples:**
- `+1 Max HP` from Dwarven Toughness  
- Ability Score Increases  
- Backstory, alignment, ideals, flaws, personality traits  
- Passive skill bonus values  
- AC calculation formulas (unless they require a choice)
